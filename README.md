For how to use this shard, check another shard [captcha](https://github.com/crystal-china/captcha).

These two libraries should be interchangeable without the need to change you code.

The different is:

- SimpleCaptcha has no external dependencies other than Crystalï¼Œso, you can 
  built static binary (if this is your's need)
- this shard captcha code only support number.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     simple_captcha:
       github: crystal-china/simple_captcha
   ```
